Here at GrowthBook we are building an open source A/B testing platform and transforming the way product decisions are made. The top 1% of companies spend thousands of hours making their own highly custom A/B testing platforms. We’ve created GrowthBook to give all companies the power and flexibility of a custom in-house experimentation system without having to build it themselves.
The world of product development is increasingly moving towards data-driven decision making, and the best way to objectively measure the impact of a product is with A/B testing. Top companies already know this, and test everything they ship. As these methods spread, A/B testing will increasingly be part of all product development processes, and will require a new set of tools which are highly integrated and customized to the product and data. GrowthBook is that platform.
Since we launched in May 2021, we’ve added over 1,500 stars on GitHub, and we are the most popular active open source experimentation platform. We’re used by hundreds of companies, and are working closely with fast-growing and large early adopters to help shape our product. Our business has increased 7x in August alone.

Here at GrowthBook we are building an open source A/B testing platform and transforming the way product decisions are made. The top 1% of companies spend thousands of hours making their own highly custom A/B testing platforms. We’ve created GrowthBook to give all companies the power and flexibility of a custom in-house experimentation system without having to build it themselves.
The world of product development is increasingly moving towards data-driven decision making, and the best way to objectively measure the impact of a product is with A/B testing. Top companies already know this, and test everything they ship. As these methods spread, A/B testing will increasingly be part of all product development processes, and will require a new set of tools which are highly integrated and customized to the product and data. GrowthBook is that platform.
Since we launched in May 2021, we’ve added over 1,500 stars on GitHub, and we are the most popular active open source experimentation platform. We’re used by hundreds of companies, and are working closely with fast-growing and large early adopters to help shape our product. Our business has increased 7x in August alone.
Our platform is built using modern tech by very experienced engineers, and backed by top investors. We believe in open source and product-led growth, and we’re focused on building something awesome that our users love.
GrowthBook is an equal opportunity employer, and is committed to creating an inclusive, supportive environment for all employees.
We regret that we cannot sponsor employment visas at this time.

Here at GrowthBook we are building an open source A/B testing platform and transforming the way product decisions are made. The top 1% of companies spend thousands of hours making their own highly custom A/B testing platforms. We’ve created GrowthBook to give all companies the power and flexibility of a custom in-house experimentation system without having to build it themselves.
The world of product development is increasingly moving towards data-driven decision making, and the best way to objectively measure the impact of a product is with A/B testing. Top companies already know this, and test everything they ship. As these methods spread, A/B testing will increasingly be part of all product development processes, and will require a new set of tools which are highly integrated and customized to the product and data. GrowthBook is that platform.
Since we launched in May 2021, we’ve added over 1,500 stars on GitHub, and we are the most popular active open source experimentation platform.

Here at GrowthBook we are building an open source A/B testing platform and transforming the way product decisions are made. The top 1% of companies spend thousands of hours making their own highly custom A/B testing platforms. We’ve created GrowthBook to give all companies the power and flexibility of a custom in-house experimentation system without having to build it themselves.
The world of product development is increasingly moving towards data-driven decision making, and the best way to objectively measure the impact of a product is with A/B testing. Top companies already know this, and test everything they ship. As these methods spread, A/B testing will increasingly be part of all product development processes, and will require a new set of tools which are highly integrated and customized to the product and data. GrowthBook is that platform.
Since we launched in May 2021, we’ve added over 1,500 stars on GitHub, and we are the most popular active open source experimentation platform. We’re used by hundreds of companies, and are working closely with fast-growing and large early adopters to help shape our product. Our business has increased 7x in August alone.
Our platform is built using modern tech by very experienced engineers, and backed by top investors. We believe in open source and product-led growth, and we’re focused on building something awesome that our users love.

Here at GrowthBook we are building an open source A/B testing platform and transforming the way product decisions are made. The top 1% of companies spend thousands of hours making their own highly custom A/B testing platforms. We’ve created GrowthBook to give all companies the power and flexibility of a custom in-house experimentation system without having to build it themselves.
The world of product development is increasingly moving towards data-driven decision making, and the best way to objectively measure the impact of a product is with A/B testing. Top companies already know this, and test everything they ship. As these methods spread, A/B testing will increasingly be part of all product development processes, and will require a new set of tools which are highly integrated and customized to the product and data. GrowthBook is that platform.
Since we launched in May 2021, we’ve added over 1,500 stars on GitHub, and we are the most popular active open source experimentation platform. We’re used by hundreds of companies, and are working closely with fast-growing and large early adopters to help shape our product. Our business has increased 7x in August alone.
Our platform is built using modern tech by very experienced engineers, and backed by top investors. We believe in open source and product-led growth, and we’re focused on building something awesome that our users love.
GrowthBook is an equal opportunity employer, and is committed to creating an inclusive, supportive environment for all employees.
We regret that we cannot sponsor employment visas at this time.

We are looking to hire a senior data scientist to join our growing team and lead our data science initiatives. This role is fully remote.

As an early employee, you will wear many hats, have opportunities to touch and influence all aspects of the product, and build a team.
Requirements
5+ years of experience of data science experience
Proficient with SQL and Python
Advanced degree in statistics or similar field (or equivalent industry experience)
You know how to balance statistical rigor vs the need to move quickly. You have a good understanding of when something is “good enough”.

Data Science & Engineering is a crucial part of Shopify’s mission to make commerce better for everyone. We organize and interpret petabytes of data to provide solutions for our merchants and stakeholders across the organization. From pipelines and schema design to machine learning products and decision support, data science at Shopify is a diverse role with many opportunities to positively impact our success. The Data Science & Engineering team acts as the impact multiplier for Shopify’s product teams, putting over 11 petabytes of data to work to make our merchants more successful. From delivering merchandising insights, to optimizing shipping and processing rates, to reducing credit card fraud, to ad campaign recommendations - our Data Scientists deliver solutions from pipeline to platform via an array of open source tools.
We are looking for a Senior Data Science Manager to lead the team that partners with our Commercial Data Science team. The Commercial team is a rapidly growing area within Shopify that plays a vital role in delivering on this vision by reaching entrepreneurs around the world and helping them succeed on Shopify. The Commercial team’s mission is to empower the most entrepreneurs to succeed. Commercial Data Science and Engineering builds data-informed growth strategies and data products that enable merchants to come, stay and grow on Shopify.
What your role will look like:
Working closely with an interdisciplinary team, you and your team will tackle challenging marketing, commercial and growth-related problems. We build strong data foundations, anomaly detection tools, and reporting frameworks to empower the growth organization to make great decisions quickly.

Analytics expertise: You’ll need to be amazing at coming up with new, meaningful metrics to measure success of our products; you'll be equally strong at making sure the data needed to support those metrics are available.
Well-balanced skills: People have trouble pinning you down. Business, product and technical teams claim you as their own. You are equal parts technical and functional (and both are exceptionally strong), and you are equally comfortable and effective at presenting to technical or business leaders.
Passionate about business strategy: You’ve experienced and thrived in similar channel-related environments and have a knack for working with business users that are responsible for top-line growth.
Team development: You’ll need a demonstrated track record of attracting top data/analytics talent, developing those people (both ICs and managers) to make them even better, and managing the growth of teams.

Data Science & Engineering is a crucial part of Shopify’s mission to make commerce better for everyone. We organize and interpret petabytes of data to provide solutions for our merchants and stakeholders across the organization. From pipelines and schema design to machine learning products and decision support, data science at Shopify is a diverse role with many opportunities to positively impact our success. The Data Science & Engineering team acts as the impact multiplier for Shopify’s product teams, putting over 11 petabytes of data to work to make our merchants more successful. From delivering merchandising insights, to optimizing shipping and processing rates, to reducing credit card fraud, to ad campaign recommendations - our Data Scientists deliver solutions from pipeline to platform via an array of open source tools.
We are looking for a Senior Data Science Manager to lead the team that partners with our Commercial Data Science team. The Commercial team is a rapidly growing area within Shopify that plays a vital role in delivering on this vision by reaching entrepreneurs around the world and helping them succeed on Shopify. The Commercial team’s mission is to empower the most entrepreneurs to succeed. Commercial Data Science and Engineering builds data-informed growth strategies and data products that enable merchants to come, stay and grow on Shopify.
What your role will look like:
Working closely with an interdisciplinary team, you and your team will tackle challenging marketing, commercial and growth-related problems. We build strong data foundations, anomaly detection tools, and reporting frameworks to empower the growth organization to make great decisions quickly.
Some of the Data Science & Engineering team members you’ll work with:

Analytics expertise: You’ll need to be amazing at coming up with new, meaningful metrics to measure success of our products; you'll be equally strong at making sure the data needed to support those metrics are available.
Well-balanced skills: People have trouble pinning you down. Business, product and technical teams claim you as their own. You are equal parts technical and functional (and both are exceptionally strong), and you are equally comfortable and effective at presenting to technical or business leaders.
Passionate about business strategy: You’ve experienced and thrived in similar channel-related environments and have a knack for working with business users that are responsible for top-line growth.

Here at GrowthBook we are building an open source A/B testing platform and transforming the way product decisions are made. The top 1% of companies spend thousands of hours making their own highly custom A/B testing platforms. We’ve created GrowthBook to give all companies the power and flexibility of a custom in-house experimentation system without having to build it themselves.
The world of product development is increasingly moving towards data-driven decision making, and the best way to objectively measure the impact of a product is with A/B testing. Top companies already know this, and test everything they ship. As these methods spread, A/B testing will increasingly be part of all product development processes, and will require a new set of tools which are highly integrated and customized to the product and data. GrowthBook is that platform.
Since we launched in May 2021, we’ve added over 1,500 stars on GitHub, and we are the most popular active open source experimentation platform. We’re used by hundreds of companies, and are working closely with fast-growing and large early adopters to help shape our product. Our business has increased 7x in August alone.
Our platform is built using modern tech by very experienced engineers, and backed by top investors. We believe in open source and product-led growth, and we’re focused on building something awesome that our users love.
GrowthBook is an equal opportunity employer, and is committed to creating an inclusive, supportive environment for all employees.
We regret that we cannot sponsor employment visas at this time.

Data Science & Engineering is a crucial part of Shopify’s mission to make commerce better for everyone. We organize and interpret petabytes of data to provide solutions for our merchants and stakeholders across the organization. From pipelines and schema design to machine learning products and decision support, data science at Shopify is a diverse role with many opportunities to positively impact our success. The Data Science & Engineering team acts as the impact multiplier for Shopify’s product teams, putting over 11 petabytes of data to work to make our merchants more successful. From delivering merchandising insights to optimizing shipping and processing rates, to reducing credit card fraud, to ad campaign recommendations - our Data Scientists deliver solutions from pipeline to the platform via an array of open source tools.
We are looking for a Senior Data Science Manager to lead the team that partners with our Operate data team (part of Core). The Shopify Core is what’s “in the box” when merchants sign up for Shopify: the world’s best Online Store, Checkout, and the Admin to set up and run their business. The Operate’s Mission is to help merchants start and run their business on Shopify’s platform by building the most powerful Admin. Operate Data Science and Engineering team contributes to this mission by building best-in-class insights and data products to enable every merchant’s success.
What your role will look like:
Working closely with an interdisciplinary team, you and your team will be responsible for the evolution of all admin tools (such as admin home, navigation, search, etc.) across mobile and web and tackle the evolution of how our most sophisticated merchants are utilizing our platform (large organizations with multiple businesses and staff). Your team will focus on developing strong data foundations, data-informed products, and reporting and experimentation frameworks to empower the Operate organization to make great decisions quickly.
Qualifications
You will need to have:
Team development: You’ll need a demonstrated track record of attracting top data/analytics talent, developing those people (both ICs and managers) to make them even better, and managing the growth of teams. You have several years of experience managing and scaling multiple teams.
Data Experience at scale: You’ve been a leader in multiple companies where analytics on top of massive data sets drives product/business decisions and results in powerful data products. You have extensive experience with technologies like SQL, Spark, and Python.
Analytics expertise: You’ll need to be amazing at coming up with new, meaningful metrics to measure the success of our products; you'll be equally strong at making sure the data needed to support those metrics are available. You have multiple years of experience managing decisions at scale, including causal inference and experimentation.
Well-balanced skills: People have trouble pinning you down. Business, product, and technical teams claim you as their own. You are equal parts technical and functional (and both are exceptionally strong), and you are equally comfortable and effective at presenting to technical or business leaders.
Passionate about business strategy: You’ve experienced and thrived in similar channel-related environments and have a knack for working with business users that are responsible for top-line growth.
Key technology stack and tools we work with:
Python
SQL
Spark
Google Cloud Platform
Mode/Tableau
Additional Information
We know that applying to a new role takes a lot of work and we truly value your time. We are looking forward to reading your application. Shopify is now permanently remote and working towards a future that is digital by default. Learn more about what this can mean for you.
At Shopify, we are committed to building and fostering an environment where our employees feel included, valued, and heard. Our belief is that a strong commitment to diversity and inclusion enables us to truly make commerce better for everyone. We strongly encourage applications from Indigenous people, racialized people, people with disabilities, people from gender and sexually diverse communities and/or people with intersectional identities.

The top 1% of companies spend thousands of hours making their own highly custom A/B testing platforms. We’ve created GrowthBook to give all companies the power and flexibility of a custom in-house experimentation system without having to build it themselves.
The world of product development is increasingly moving towards data-driven decision making, and the best way to objectively measure the impact of a product is with A/B testing. Top companies already know this, and test everything they ship. As these methods spread, A/B testing will increasingly be part of all product development processes, and will require a new set of tools which are highly integrated and customized to the product and data. GrowthBook is that platform.
Since we launched in May 2021, we’ve added over 1,500 stars on GitHub, and we are the most popular active open source experimentation platform.

The top 1% of companies spend thousands of hours making their own highly custom A/B testing platforms. We’ve created GrowthBook to give all companies the power and flexibility of a custom in-house experimentation system without having to build it themselves.
The world of product development is increasingly moving towards data-driven decision making, and the best way to objectively measure the impact of a product is with A/B testing. Top companies already know this, and test everything they ship. As these methods spread, A/B testing will increasingly be part of all product development processes, and will require a new set of tools which are highly integrated and customized to the product and data. GrowthBook is that platform.
Since we launched in May 2021, we’ve added over 1,500 stars on GitHub, and we are the most popular active open source experimentation platform. We’re used by hundreds of companies, and are working closely with fast-growing and large early adopters to help shape our product. Our business has increased 7x in August alone.
