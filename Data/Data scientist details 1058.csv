We organize and interpret petabytes of data to provide solutions for our merchants and stakeholders across the organization. From pipelines and schema design to machine learning products and decision support, data science at Shopify is a diverse role with many opportunities to positively impact our success. The Data Science & Engineering team acts as the impact multiplier for Shopify’s product teams, putting over 11 petabytes of data to work to make our merchants more successful. From delivering merchandising insights, to optimizing shipping and processing rates, to reducing credit card fraud, to ad campaign recommendations - our Data Scientists deliver solutions from pipeline to platform via an array of open source tools.
We are looking for a Senior Data Science Manager to lead the team that partners with our Commercial Data Science team. The Commercial team is a rapidly growing area within Shopify that plays a vital role in delivering on this vision by reaching entrepreneurs around the world and helping them succeed on Shopify. The Commercial team’s mission is to empower the most entrepreneurs to succeed. Commercial Data Science and Engineering builds data-informed growth strategies and data products that enable merchants to come, stay and grow on Shopify.
What your role will look like:
Working closely with an interdisciplinary team, you and your team will tackle challenging marketing, commercial and growth-related problems. We build strong data foundations, anomaly detection tools, and reporting frameworks to empower the growth organization to make great decisions quickly.

Analytics expertise: You’ll need to be amazing at coming up with new, meaningful metrics to measure success of our products; you'll be equally strong at making sure the data needed to support those metrics are available.
Well-balanced skills: People have trouble pinning you down. Business, product and technical teams claim you as their own. You are equal parts technical and functional (and both are exceptionally strong), and you are equally comfortable and effective at presenting to technical or business leaders.
Passionate about business strategy: You’ve experienced and thrived in similar channel-related environments and have a knack for working with business users that are responsible for top-line growth.
