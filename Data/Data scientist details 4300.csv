We’ve created GrowthBook to give all companies the power and flexibility of a custom in-house experimentation system without having to build it themselves.
The world of product development is increasingly moving towards data-driven decision making, and the best way to objectively measure the impact of a product is with A/B testing. Top companies already know this, and test everything they ship. As these methods spread, A/B testing will increasingly be part of all product development processes, and will require a new set of tools which are highly integrated and customized to the product and data. GrowthBook is that platform.
Since we launched in May 2021, we’ve added over 1,500 stars on GitHub, and we are the most popular active open source experimentation platform. We’re used by hundreds of companies, and are working closely with fast-growing and large early adopters to help shape our product. Our business has increased 7x in August alone.

We’ve created GrowthBook to give all companies the power and flexibility of a custom in-house experimentation system without having to build it themselves.
The world of product development is increasingly moving towards data-driven decision making, and the best way to objectively measure the impact of a product is with A/B testing.

Here at GrowthBook we are building an open source A/B testing platform and transforming the way product decisions are made. The top 1% of companies spend thousands of hours making their own highly custom A/B testing platforms. We’ve created GrowthBook to give all companies the power and flexibility of a custom in-house experimentation system without having to build it themselves.
The world of product development is increasingly moving towards data-driven decision making, and the best way to objectively measure the impact of a product is with A/B testing. Top companies already know this, and test everything they ship. As these methods spread, A/B testing will increasingly be part of all product development processes, and will require a new set of tools which are highly integrated and customized to the product and data. GrowthBook is that platform.
Since we launched in May 2021, we’ve added over 1,500 stars on GitHub, and we are the most popular active open source experimentation platform. We’re used by hundreds of companies, and are working closely with fast-growing and large early adopters to help shape our product. Our business has increased 7x in August alone.
Our platform is built using modern tech by very experienced engineers, and backed by top investors. We believe in open source and product-led growth, and we’re focused on building something awesome that our users love.
