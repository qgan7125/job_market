Our first core value is ""People First"" and the pandemic has reinforced how true this value reigns to us. Our office is located in the Chicago loop, and those that want to may work in-office. For the rest of us, we have ""figured out"" how to work remotely and we will continue to do so until it's safe. We know the world is shifting and we are too. What is the future of BenchPrep's plans for working in-office or remote? We haven't figured it out exactly - but what we do know is collaboration and connection are our top priorities.

About Company</b><p><br/>
Turion Space was formed with the vision of building the technology required for humanity's interplanetary future. Our short-term goal is to solve the most significant threat to that vision - orbital debris. The exponential growth of spacecraft and launch vehicles entering Earth's orbits has dramatically increased the risk of collisions. Even a small number of these conjunctions will lead to the inaccessibility of the final frontier. We are developing the technology to stabilize this threat. This challenge will also serve as a test-bed for future asteroid resource extraction.</p></div></div>>"

In a world where data drives decisions, opportunity and innovation, the importance trusted data simply cannot be overstated. Because when data matters, you must be able to trust your data and Master Data Management (MDM) is the path that forward thinking organizations take to ensure a trusted data foundation.</p><p>The Master Data Management (MDM) market is listed modestly at $2B and has only been 10% penetrated. Profisee is quickly grabbing share of this market as we are disrupting old MDM ways by dismantling MDM perceptions of complexity and cost. We are building an enduring company and a platform that emphasizes the value of the data-enabled future. Built for fast growth, we value high-energy, integrity and trusted collaboration.</p><p>In addition, Profisee was selected as one of Atlanta’s Top Places to Work in 2021 by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. You will become part of an amazing culture with a supportive CEO and smart teammates who want to see you progress in your career.</p><p>*<br/>Position Summary: *</p><p>Profisee is looking for an experienced Software Developer (3-5yrs) to join our R&amp;D team to help accelerate the value R&amp;D delivers to our customers, partners, and internal stakeholders by delivering innovative new features that will strengthen Profisee’s position as a leader in the MDM space.</p><p>Profisee is a growing Microsoft gold-certified partner focused on data management solutions in general and, more specifically, in the area of Master Data Management. We work with leading-edge technology and you will have the opportunity to develop your skills as a full-stack engineer working on both web front-end, business tier, and data tier in both an on-premise as well as cloud technology environment.</p><p>The Software Developer will report to one of our 3 Development Team Leads, <b>and work out of Profisee’s headquarters in Alpharetta, GA</b>. You will work within a development team alongside other development and QA peers.</p><p>*<br/>Performance Objectives: *</p><p>*<br/>Primary Objective: * Contributing to the design, development and delivery of new features in the Profisee Platform. This begins by working with your team lead and team members to understand new feature requirements, including their underlying business drivers and benefits. Once understood, work with other developers, team leads and architects to design new features and decompose them into user stories. For stories assigned to you, work to check-in completed user stories, including the technical implementation with supporting unit tests, and then collaborate with QA on testing and resolution of any bugs.</p><p>*<br/>Secondary Objective: * Contribute to Profisee’s R&amp;D team by bringing new knowledge, experience and ideas to the team, driving individual and team growth. Profisee has a number of newer college graduates, and you will need to be capable of mentoring less experienced members of the team, helping them grow as technologists and team members. At the same time, you should be excited to collaborate with others on the team with different experiences and perspectives to grow your own skillset and capabilities.</p><p>*<br/>Long-Term Objective: * Grow into Senior Software Developer with further options to transition to a Development Team Lead or Software Architect within R&amp;D. As we continue to grow R&amp;D, we will form additional development teams to prevent individual teams from becoming too large. Developers demonstrating strong engineering and planning skills will be natural candidates to take on a Team Lead or Software Architect roles.</p><p>*<br/>Technical Leadership: * As a Software Developer, you should able to write high quality software across the technology stack – web and desktop UI, services, and database tier - following best practices such as clean architecture principles with minimal oversight, and contribute to development process improvements over time through collaboration with the broader team. To do so, you should be able to leverage knowledge gained from formalized education as well as past experiences delivering software solutions. As a new member of the team, you will need to become productive quickly by rapidly understanding the current architecture and code base of the Profisee Platform, developed using C#, .NET, and SQL Server, so that you can start developing user stories within the first 60 days.</p><p>*<br/>Be Innovative: * Help Profisee push the envelope around technology innovation in the area of Master Data Management software. Profisee is evolving our software architecture towards a cloud-native architecture deployed using containers and micro-services. Developers must be eager to tackle new technologies and challenges we encounter along that journey, including the delivery of new components as micro-services, or breaking existing components out as they’re evolved to the new micro-services architecture. Developers must be willing to continually learn, evaluate and propose new technologies and approaches which can be used to deliver innovative features in the product.</p><p>*<br/>Be Agile: * Profisee employs an Agile methodology for software development. Everyone in R&amp;D should be comfortable working within an Agile software development environment. As a Software Developer, you should be actively participating in all aspects of the Agile lifecycle, including sprint planning, story writing, story pointing, daily standups, and reviews and retrospectives.</p><p>*<br/>Learn &amp; Grow: * Profisee’s culture values what we refer to as the “Growth Mindset” which supports the notion that we can learn and do anything if we put our mind to it. Our capacity to grow both professionally and personally is unlimited. If you want to be surrounded by a team that believes in and supports your ability to challenge yourself and, occasionally make mistakes as long as we learn from them, then Profisee is the place for you. You’ll be supported in keeping your skills current and sharing your knowledge through our , sprint reviews, and book clubs where like-minded Developers explore new and emerging technologies.</p><p><i>Local (Georgia, USA) candidates only; no relocation</i></p><p>*<br/>Company Values*<br/>The candidate should be aware that Profisee takes Core Values very seriously; they are not just words on a wall. We live by them everyday and want to attract like mind thinkers. Profisee is proud to be an equal opportunity workplace dedicated to pursuing and hiring a diverse workforce. We want candidates of all human varieties, background and lifestyles. There’s no problem that can’t be made better by bringing together people with a broader set of perspectives.

There are no limits and we accept mistakes as a part of growing and trying new things. This is one of the things that makes work, life, and our environment both fun and rewarding.</p><p>*<br/>Constructive<b>* Candor</b>* - Everyone feels comfortable voicing their opinions and knows how each other feels when we leave a room. This enables us to get to the heart of issues quickly; hopefully disagreeing at times and enjoying diverse perspectives with the purpose of finding the best answer, not defending our own.*</p><p>*<br/>Helpful: *Strives to assist, mentor, coach and assist your fellow Profisors to their highest potential and for them to be successful in every endeavor. Always has time to lend a hand, answer a question or share knowledge with your fellow employees as a matter of normal business and not as an exception.</p><p>*<br/>Get Stuff Done: *Successfully completes crucial aspects of deliverables with a hands-on approach, including personal correspondence written and verbal, and other tasks that facilitates the CEO’s ability to effectively lead the company. Prioritizes conflicting needs; handles matters expeditiously, proactively, and follows-through on projects to successful completion, often with deadline pressures.</p><p>*<br/>Fun is Where<b>* Fun is Made - </b>Professional life is as enjoyable and rewarding as we make it. We covet the journey as much as the destination and strive to make each other laugh along the way.</p><p>*<br/>Equal Employment Opportunity*</p><p>To provide equal employment and advancement opportunities to all individuals, employment decisions at the Company will be based on merit, qualifications, and abilities.

In a world where data drives decisions, opportunity and innovation, the importance trusted data simply cannot be overstated. Because when data matters, you must be able to trust your data and Master Data Management (MDM) is the path that forward thinking organizations take to ensure a trusted data foundation.</p><p>The Master Data Management (MDM) market is listed modestly at $2B and has only been 10% penetrated. Profisee is quickly grabbing share of this market as we are disrupting old MDM ways by dismantling MDM perceptions of complexity and cost. We are building an enduring company and a platform that emphasizes the value of the data-enabled future. Built for fast growth, we value high-energy, integrity and trusted collaboration.</p><p>In addition, Profisee was selected as one of Atlanta’s Top Places to Work in 2021 by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. You will become part of an amazing culture with a supportive CEO and smart teammates who want to see you progress in your career.</p><p>*<br/>Position Summary: *</p><p>Profisee is looking for an experienced Software Developer (3-5yrs) to join our R&amp;D team to help accelerate the value R&amp;D delivers to our customers, partners, and internal stakeholders by delivering innovative new features that will strengthen Profisee’s position as a leader in the MDM space.</p><p>Profisee is a growing Microsoft gold-certified partner focused on data management solutions in general and, more specifically, in the area of Master Data Management. We work with leading-edge technology and you will have the opportunity to develop your skills as a full-stack engineer working on both web front-end, business tier, and data tier in both an on-premise as well as cloud technology environment.</p><p>The Software Developer will report to one of our 3 Development Team Leads, <b>and work out of Profisee’s headquarters in Alpharetta, GA</b>. You will work within a development team alongside other development and QA peers.</p><p>*<br/>Performance Objectives: *</p><p>*<br/>Primary Objective: * Contributing to the design, development and delivery of new features in the Profisee Platform. This begins by working with your team lead and team members to understand new feature requirements, including their underlying business drivers and benefits. Once understood, work with other developers, team leads and architects to design new features and decompose them into user stories. For stories assigned to you, work to check-in completed user stories, including the technical implementation with supporting unit tests, and then collaborate with QA on testing and resolution of any bugs.</p><p>*<br/>Secondary Objective: * Contribute to Profisee’s R&amp;D team by bringing new knowledge, experience and ideas to the team, driving individual and team growth. Profisee has a number of newer college graduates, and you will need to be capable of mentoring less experienced members of the team, helping them grow as technologists and team members. At the same time, you should be excited to collaborate with others on the team with different experiences and perspectives to grow your own skillset and capabilities.</p><p>*<br/>Long-Term Objective: * Grow into Senior Software Developer with further options to transition to a Development Team Lead or Software Architect within R&amp;D. As we continue to grow R&amp;D, we will form additional development teams to prevent individual teams from becoming too large. Developers demonstrating strong engineering and planning skills will be natural candidates to take on a Team Lead or Software Architect roles.</p><p>*<br/>Technical Leadership: * As a Software Developer, you should able to write high quality software across the technology stack – web and desktop UI, services, and database tier - following best practices such as clean architecture principles with minimal oversight, and contribute to development process improvements over time through collaboration with the broader team. To do so, you should be able to leverage knowledge gained from formalized education as well as past experiences delivering software solutions. As a new member of the team, you will need to become productive quickly by rapidly understanding the current architecture and code base of the Profisee Platform, developed using C#, .NET, and SQL Server, so that you can start developing user stories within the first 60 days.</p><p>*<br/>Be Innovative: * Help Profisee push the envelope around technology innovation in the area of Master Data Management software. Profisee is evolving our software architecture towards a cloud-native architecture deployed using containers and micro-services. Developers must be eager to tackle new technologies and challenges we encounter along that journey, including the delivery of new components as micro-services, or breaking existing components out as they’re evolved to the new micro-services architecture. Developers must be willing to continually learn, evaluate and propose new technologies and approaches which can be used to deliver innovative features in the product.</p><p>*<br/>Be Agile: * Profisee employs an Agile methodology for software development. Everyone in R&amp;D should be comfortable working within an Agile software development environment. As a Software Developer, you should be actively participating in all aspects of the Agile lifecycle, including sprint planning, story writing, story pointing, daily standups, and reviews and retrospectives.</p><p>*<br/>Learn &amp; Grow: * Profisee’s culture values what we refer to as the “Growth Mindset” which supports the notion that we can learn and do anything if we put our mind to it. Our capacity to grow both professionally and personally is unlimited. If you want to be surrounded by a team that believes in and supports your ability to challenge yourself and, occasionally make mistakes as long as we learn from them, then Profisee is the place for you. You’ll be supported in keeping your skills current and sharing your knowledge through our , sprint reviews, and book clubs where like-minded Developers explore new and emerging technologies.</p><p><i>Local (Georgia, USA) candidates only; no relocation</i></p><p>*<br/>Company Values*<br/>The candidate should be aware that Profisee takes Core Values very seriously; they are not just words on a wall. We live by them everyday and want to attract like mind thinkers. Profisee is proud to be an equal opportunity workplace dedicated to pursuing and hiring a diverse workforce. We want candidates of all human varieties, background and lifestyles. There’s no problem that can’t be made better by bringing together people with a broader set of perspectives.

There are no limits and we accept mistakes as a part of growing and trying new things. This is one of the things that makes work, life, and our environment both fun and rewarding.</p><p>*<br/>Constructive<b>* Candor</b>* - Everyone feels comfortable voicing their opinions and knows how each other feels when we leave a room. This enables us to get to the heart of issues quickly; hopefully disagreeing at times and enjoying diverse perspectives with the purpose of finding the best answer, not defending our own.*</p><p>*<br/>Helpful: *Strives to assist, mentor, coach and assist your fellow Profisors to their highest potential and for them to be successful in every endeavor. Always has time to lend a hand, answer a question or share knowledge with your fellow employees as a matter of normal business and not as an exception.</p><p>*<br/>Get Stuff Done: *Successfully completes crucial aspects of deliverables with a hands-on approach, including personal correspondence written and verbal, and other tasks that facilitates the CEO’s ability to effectively lead the company. Prioritizes conflicting needs; handles matters expeditiously, proactively, and follows-through on projects to successful completion, often with deadline pressures.</p><p>*<br/>Fun is Where<b>* Fun is Made - </b>Professional life is as enjoyable and rewarding as we make it. We covet the journey as much as the destination and strive to make each other laugh along the way.</p><p>*<br/>Equal Employment Opportunity*</p><p>To provide equal employment and advancement opportunities to all individuals, employment decisions at the Company will be based on merit, qualifications, and abilities.

369,Front end software engineer,Catalia Health,,"['San Francisco, CA 94105 (Yerba Buena area)']",,5 days ago,2021-09-06,https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=24250cbc6d9529a7&fccid=512703e9f9fc23df&vjs=3,,['Full-time'],,,"<bound method PageElement.format_string of <div class=""jobsearch-jobDescriptionText"" id=""jobDescriptionText""><div>Company Description<p><br/>
Catalia Health is working to improve the way people coping with illness comply with taking their medication and managing chronic disease. Our Mabu healthcare coach is a novel interactive robotic companion built on top of psychological theories of relationship development combined with current human-robot interaction work. This core platform builds strong relationships between the robot and the patient by having regular conversations to help them better manage their ongoing healthcare challenges. The information generated as a result of these conversations is shared with their doctor to help to improve their overall care.</p><p>
The Mabu platform is based on founder Dr. Cory Kidd’s 15+ years of experience in healthcare technology and human-robot interaction. This is combined with a strong core team that has been developing the technology (hardware and software) and user experience for most of the past year. Mabu was designed in collaboration with IDEO, the pre-eminent design firm, while Catalia Health was Startup in Residence at IDEO’s San Francisco studio for five months.</p><p>
Catalia Health is backed by a group of investors that includes some large Silicon Valley funds. We have major industry customers with whom we are rolling out our products. We’re looking for collaborators who want to join a team focused on solving real-world healthcare challenges for a large number of people.</p><p>
We’re a small, tight team working to change the future of healthcare. We work hard but spend our evenings and weekends at home (or out — it’s your time). We’re a healthcare company foremost, so everyone’s well-being is our priority. We were very remote-friendly before COVID-19 (and about 50% remote), so are flexible on your location. Our one office is in San Francisco, so if you’re in the Bay Area or want to be, you’re welcome to work there once we reopen the office.</p><p>
We welcome diversity and believe in hiring the right person as opposed to the right combination of buzzwords. We’re more interested in hiring enthusiastic learners looking to grow than we are in hiring know-it-all’s and been-there-done-that’s. Come grow with us.</p></div>
<br/>
<div>Job Description<p><br/>
This role is to create a bridge between our content development and engineering teams. After a conversation with Mabu is designed and dialogue has been written, that text needs to go into a format that can be used by Mabu’s conversation engine, along with additional scripting files to support the flow of conversation. In this role, you will receive Mabu dialogue and conversation design instructions from the content team, then create/populate conversation files (trees), Python/Lua script files, and enter/update dialogue into the correct databases. The resulting conversation can then be run on Mabu for review, iteration, and eventually as a full product. For this role, we are looking for scripting experience, organization, and most importantly, someone who enjoys collaborating with both the technical and non-technical roles involved in the product creation process.</p></div>
<br/>
<div>Qualifications<br/>
<ul><li>
Python scripting experience (or similar, such as Lua)</li><li>
Highly organized and logical thinker, good at translating between non-technical and technical team members. Excited to work with our content and medical team.</li><li>
CS/IT/IS background or programming experience</li><li>
Familiarity with database structures</li><li>
Interest in conversation design</li></ul><br/>
Additional Information<p><br/>
A cover letter is required. Please tell us why you want to work at Catalia Health and why you are the right candidate for the job.</p><p>

Catalia Health is working to improve the way people coping with illness comply with taking their medication and managing chronic disease. Our Mabu healthcare coach is a novel interactive robotic companion built on top of psychological theories of relationship development combined with current human-robot interaction work. This core platform builds strong relationships between the robot and the patient by having regular conversations to help them better manage their ongoing healthcare challenges. The information generated as a result of these conversations is shared with their doctor to help to improve their overall care.</p><p>
The Mabu platform is based on founder Dr. Cory Kidd’s 15+ years of experience in healthcare technology and human-robot interaction. This is combined with a strong core team that has been developing the technology (hardware and software) and user experience for most of the past year. Mabu was designed in collaboration with IDEO, the pre-eminent design firm, while Catalia Health was Startup in Residence at IDEO’s San Francisco studio for five months.</p><p>
Catalia Health is backed by a group of investors that includes some large Silicon Valley funds. We have major industry customers with whom we are rolling out our products. We’re looking for collaborators who want to join a team focused on solving real-world healthcare challenges for a large number of people.</p><p>
We’re a small, tight team working to change the future of healthcare. We work hard but spend our evenings and weekends at home (or out — it’s your time). We’re a healthcare company foremost, so everyone’s well-being is our priority. We were very remote-friendly before COVID-19 (and about 50% remote), so are flexible on your location. Our one office is in San Francisco, so if you’re in the Bay Area or want to be, you’re welcome to work there once we reopen the office.</p><p>
We welcome diversity and believe in hiring the right person as opposed to the right combination of buzzwords. We’re more interested in hiring enthusiastic learners looking to grow than we are in hiring know-it-all’s and been-there-done-that’s. Come grow with us.</p></div>
<br/>
<div>Job Description<p><br/>
This role is to create a bridge between our content development and engineering teams. After a conversation with Mabu is designed and dialogue has been written, that text needs to go into a format that can be used by Mabu’s conversation engine, along with additional scripting files to support the flow of conversation. In this role, you will receive Mabu dialogue and conversation design instructions from the content team, then create/populate conversation files (trees), Python/Lua script files, and enter/update dialogue into the correct databases. The resulting conversation can then be run on Mabu for review, iteration, and eventually as a full product. For this role, we are looking for scripting experience, organization, and most importantly, someone who enjoys collaborating with both the technical and non-technical roles involved in the product creation process.</p></div>
<br/>
<div>Qualifications<br/>
<ul><li>
Python scripting experience (or similar, such as Lua)</li><li>
Highly organized and logical thinker, good at translating between non-technical and technical team members. Excited to work with our content and medical team.</li><li>
CS/IT/IS background or programming experience</li><li>
Familiarity with database structures</li><li>
Interest in conversation design</li></ul><br/>
Additional Information<p><br/>
A cover letter is required. Please tell us why you want to work at Catalia Health and why you are the right candidate for the job.</p><p>

In a world where data drives decisions, opportunity and innovation, the importance trusted data simply cannot be overstated. Because when data matters, you must be able to trust your data and Master Data Management (MDM) is the path that forward thinking organizations take to ensure a trusted data foundation.</p><p>The Master Data Management (MDM) market is listed modestly at $2B and has only been 10% penetrated. Profisee is quickly grabbing share of this market as we are disrupting old MDM ways by dismantling MDM perceptions of complexity and cost. We are building an enduring company and a platform that emphasizes the value of the data-enabled future. Built for fast growth, we value high-energy, integrity and trusted collaboration.</p><p>In addition, Profisee was selected as one of Atlanta’s Top Places to Work in 2021 by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. You will become part of an amazing culture with a supportive CEO and smart teammates who want to see you progress in your career.</p><p>*<br/>Position Summary: *</p><p>Profisee is looking for an experienced Software Developer (3-5yrs) to join our R&amp;D team to help accelerate the value R&amp;D delivers to our customers, partners, and internal stakeholders by delivering innovative new features that will strengthen Profisee’s position as a leader in the MDM space.</p><p>Profisee is a growing Microsoft gold-certified partner focused on data management solutions in general and, more specifically, in the area of Master Data Management. We work with leading-edge technology and you will have the opportunity to develop your skills as a full-stack engineer working on both web front-end, business tier, and data tier in both an on-premise as well as cloud technology environment.</p><p>The Software Developer will report to one of our 3 Development Team Leads, <b>and work out of Profisee’s headquarters in Alpharetta, GA</b>. You will work within a development team alongside other development and QA peers.</p><p>*<br/>Performance Objectives: *</p><p>*<br/>Primary Objective: * Contributing to the design, development and delivery of new features in the Profisee Platform. This begins by working with your team lead and team members to understand new feature requirements, including their underlying business drivers and benefits. Once understood, work with other developers, team leads and architects to design new features and decompose them into user stories. For stories assigned to you, work to check-in completed user stories, including the technical implementation with supporting unit tests, and then collaborate with QA on testing and resolution of any bugs.</p><p>*<br/>Secondary Objective: * Contribute to Profisee’s R&amp;D team by bringing new knowledge, experience and ideas to the team, driving individual and team growth. Profisee has a number of newer college graduates, and you will need to be capable of mentoring less experienced members of the team, helping them grow as technologists and team members. At the same time, you should be excited to collaborate with others on the team with different experiences and perspectives to grow your own skillset and capabilities.</p><p>*<br/>Long-Term Objective: * Grow into Senior Software Developer with further options to transition to a Development Team Lead or Software Architect within R&amp;D.

To do so, you should be able to leverage knowledge gained from formalized education as well as past experiences delivering software solutions. As a new member of the team, you will need to become productive quickly by rapidly understanding the current architecture and code base of the Profisee Platform, developed using C#, .NET, and SQL Server, so that you can start developing user stories within the first 60 days.</p><p>*<br/>Be Innovative: * Help Profisee push the envelope around technology innovation in the area of Master Data Management software. Profisee is evolving our software architecture towards a cloud-native architecture deployed using containers and micro-services. Developers must be eager to tackle new technologies and challenges we encounter along that journey, including the delivery of new components as micro-services, or breaking existing components out as they’re evolved to the new micro-services architecture.

Catalia Health is working to improve the way people coping with illness comply with taking their medication and managing chronic disease. Our Mabu healthcare coach is a novel interactive robotic companion built on top of psychological theories of relationship development combined with current human-robot interaction work. This core platform builds strong relationships between the robot and the patient by having regular conversations to help them better manage their ongoing healthcare challenges. The information generated as a result of these conversations is shared with their doctor to help to improve their overall care.</p><p>
The Mabu platform is based on founder Dr. Cory Kidd’s 15+ years of experience in healthcare technology and human-robot interaction. This is combined with a strong core team that has been developing the technology (hardware and software) and user experience for most of the past year. Mabu was designed in collaboration with IDEO, the pre-eminent design firm, while Catalia Health was Startup in Residence at IDEO’s San Francisco studio for five months.</p><p>
Catalia Health is backed by a group of investors that includes some large Silicon Valley funds. We have major industry customers with whom we are rolling out our products. We’re looking for collaborators who want to join a team focused on solving real-world healthcare challenges for a large number of people.</p><p>
We’re a small, tight team working to change the future of healthcare. We work hard but spend our evenings and weekends at home (or out — it’s your time). We’re a healthcare company foremost, so everyone’s well-being is our priority. We were very remote-friendly before COVID-19 (and about 50% remote), so are flexible on your location. Our one office is in San Francisco, so if you’re in the Bay Area or want to be, you’re welcome to work there once we reopen the office.</p><p>
We welcome diversity and believe in hiring the right person as opposed to the right combination of buzzwords. We’re more interested in hiring enthusiastic learners looking to grow than we are in hiring know-it-all’s and been-there-done-that’s. Come grow with us.</p></div>

Catalia Health is working to improve the way people coping with illness comply with taking their medication and managing chronic disease. Our Mabu healthcare coach is a novel interactive robotic companion built on top of psychological theories of relationship development combined with current human-robot interaction work. This core platform builds strong relationships between the robot and the patient by having regular conversations to help them better manage their ongoing healthcare challenges. The information generated as a result of these conversations is shared with their doctor to help to improve their overall care.</p><p>
The Mabu platform is based on founder Dr. Cory Kidd’s 15+ years of experience in healthcare technology and human-robot interaction. This is combined with a strong core team that has been developing the technology (hardware and software) and user experience for most of the past year. Mabu was designed in collaboration with IDEO, the pre-eminent design firm, while Catalia Health was Startup in Residence at IDEO’s San Francisco studio for five months.</p><p>

We’re a small, tight team working to change the future of healthcare. We work hard but spend our evenings and weekends at home (or out — it’s your time). We’re a healthcare company foremost, so everyone’s well-being is our priority. We were very remote-friendly before COVID-19 (and about 50% remote), so are flexible on your location. Our one office is in San Francisco, so if you’re in the Bay Area or want to be, you’re welcome to work there once we reopen the office.</p><p>
We welcome diversity and believe in hiring the right person as opposed to the right combination of buzzwords. We’re more interested in hiring enthusiastic learners looking to grow than we are in hiring know-it-all’s and been-there-done-that’s. Come grow with us.</p></div>

American Airlines believes that our purpose is to care for our people on life's journey, customer or team member. We want teams to let that care guide how we work and what we build. As a developer on a product team at American Airlines you will create awesome experiences. Your team owns those experiences from conception to production, for millions of customers and more than 100,000 team members.</p><p></p><p><br/>
Our goal is to create an enviable, engineering-centric workplace. What does that mean though? Deploying is painless, you have a strong voice, communication flows, we experiment with our products, and we exploit new technology to continuously improve how we work. Of course, we also want to make sure we are having fun, working with, and caring for - amazing people.</p></div></div><div><div><h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>
Why you'll love this job</b></h2></div><div><p>
Successful Software Developers at American Airlines excel in three key areas:</p><ul><li>
Software Delivery</li><li>
Product Mindset</li><li>
Growth Mindset</li></ul><p></p><p><br/>
Software Development Teams at American Airlines find ways to improve daily work. This means taking an honest look at delivery metrics and asking what we will do to improve them. We expect a team to ask <i>""why has our deployment frequency declined over the last month?""</i> and work towards a solution to improve the situation as a team, under their own direction. In short, we want everyone to invest in continually improving themselves and their ways of working, while achieving product success.</p><p></p><p><br/>
You will engage in all aspects of the Product lifecycle and work to grow your skills in Lean Product Development. We expect our engineers to dig in and solve business problems as true partners. We love small solutions and collecting data to draw conclusions.</p><p></p><p><br/>
To build new solutions and chase new hypotheses, our teams are constantly learning. We accept failures as learning experiences and use those experiences to build resiliency in our systems.</p><p></p><p><br/>
Depending on level, the role is a balance of technical coaching and hands-on development work. All Software Developers write code daily, regardless of level.</p></div></div><div><div><h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>

Requisition ID: 41105</p><div><div><div><h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>
Intro</b></h2></div><div><p>
American Airlines is looking for Software Developers of all levels. As a Software Developer at American Airlines, we expect you to be empathetic towards customers. American Airlines believes that our purpose is to care for our people on life's journey, customer or team member. We want teams to let that care guide how we work and what we build. As a developer on a product team at American Airlines you will create awesome experiences. Your team owns those experiences from conception to production, for millions of customers and more than 100,000 team members.</p><p></p><p><br/>
Our goal is to create an enviable, engineering-centric workplace. What does that mean though? Deploying is painless, you have a strong voice, communication flows, we experiment with our products, and we exploit new technology to continuously improve how we work. Of course, we also want to make sure we are having fun, working with, and caring for - amazing people.</p></div></div><div><div><h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>
Why you'll love this job</b></h2></div><div><p>
Successful Software Developers at American Airlines excel in three key areas:</p><ul><li>
Software Delivery</li><li>
Product Mindset</li><li>
Growth Mindset</li></ul><p></p><p><br/>
Software Development Teams at American Airlines find ways to improve daily work. This means taking an honest look at delivery metrics and asking what we will do to improve them. We expect a team to ask <i>""why has our deployment frequency declined over the last month?""</i> and work towards a solution to improve the situation as a team, under their own direction. In short, we want everyone to invest in continually improving themselves and their ways of working, while achieving product success.</p><p></p><p><br/>
You will engage in all aspects of the Product lifecycle and work to grow your skills in Lean Product Development. We expect our engineers to dig in and solve business problems as true partners. We love small solutions and collecting data to draw conclusions.</p><p></p><p><br/>
To build new solutions and chase new hypotheses, our teams are constantly learning. We accept failures as learning experiences and use those experiences to build resiliency in our systems.</p><p></p><p><br/>

<p>
Calibrate's mission is to change the way the world treats weight. We're defining a new category in metabolic health that mirrors what the research shows—that weight reflects our biology, not our willpower. Our program was designed by world leaders in obesity and nutrition science to improve metabolic health and drive long-term weight loss that's impactful, realistic, and sustainable.</p><br/>
<p></p>
<p>
Obesity is America's underlying pandemic and largest category of chronic disease, and Calibrate is closing the gap in care for 175mm adults in a $600bn market where we spend millions of dollars each year and do not lose millions of pounds.</p><br/>
<p></p>
<p>
To bring Calibrate to everyone who needs it, we're building the first telemedicine business within the healthcare ecosystem, aligning incentives for consumers, doctors, insurers, and pharmaceutical companies. We've built a proprietary Vertical Pharmacy Engine to connect our members to the most efficient path to insurance coverage, paving the way for a new model of chronic disease care.</p><br/>
<p></p>
<p>
Calibrate's first product, the One-Year Metabolic Reset, brings decades of clinical research directly to consumers through a virtual program combining FDA-approved prescription medication with intensive lifestyle intervention. The 52-week structured program includes biweekly 1:1 video coaching and curriculum that spans classes, recipes, workouts, and more. A purpose-built app enables daily tracking of food, energy level, weight, and bi-weekly goals and helps members interact with their Coaching and Medical teams, while a members' group and events calendar create additional opportunities to tap into the Calibrate community.</p><br/>
<p></p>
<p>
Calibrate's recently launched Masters Program keeps members engaged and supported in their metabolic health beyond their first year with the same evidence-based approach that defines Calibrate's One-Year Metabolic Reset, at a lower cost. The result is a program that sustains and builds on members' results with improved whole-body health that enables them to embrace a new day-to-day.</p>
<p><b>
ABOUT THE ROLE</b></p>
<p>
We are looking for a <b>Front End Engineer </b>to join our growing engineering team. As an early member of the team, you are not just an engineer. You will have the chance to define and work on the foundational elements of the company, work closely with the founding team and set the technical direction of the product.</p>
<p>
The ideal candidate is as passionate about creating seamless customer experiences as they are about solving problems with elegant solutions. You will work on our inbound member experience, and partner with the product team to bring customer touchpoints to life.</p>
<p><b>
Products you will build and work on:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Consumer facing application (web) to engage and change behaviors to improve weight health.</li>
<li>Growth products to drive sales from initial ad campaigns through conversion.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>KEY RESPONSIBILITIES</b></p>
<ul>
<li>As an early engineer on the team, you will help define our front end web practices.</li>
<li>Partner with the Product Management team to design and build our first scalable, consumer platforms to launch and grow a brand new healthcare company.</li>
<li>Develop and scale the internal and externally facing product.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>BACKGROUND AND EXPERIENCE</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Little or some relevant experience in front end web application development (0-2 years)</li>
<li>Experience with frontend programming (JavaScript/CSS/HTML for languages, and Vue / React for frameworks)</li>
<li>Demonstrates a willingness to learn</li>
<li>Understands related technology but probably not familiar with most of it</li></ul><br/>
<p></p>
<p><b>
ABOUT OUR TEAM</b></p>
<p>
Calibrate launched Summer 2020, and in 18 months has raised $127.6mm in funding from leading healthcare and consumer investors, including Founders Fund, Tiger Global, Forerunner Ventures, Threshold Ventures, Optum Ventures, and Redesign Health. Our team helped build businesses at the intersection of technology, consumer, and healthcare, including Athenahealth, Capsule, Flatiron Health, Harry's, One Medical, Galileo, PillPack, Rent the Runway, and more. Our Clinical Advisors include Donna Ryan, the past President of the World Obesity Federation, and Darriush Mozafarrian, cardiologist and Dean at the Tufts Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy.</p>
<p><i>
Calibrate is committed to bringing together people from different backgrounds and perspectives to deliver real results for our members.</i></p>
<p><b>
BENEFITS</b></p>
<p><i>
At Calibrate, we're committed to our vision of putting our members and our teammates in control of their health. Some of our benefits include:</i></p>

<p><b>OUR VALUES</b></p>
<p><b>
We're in it together</b>: We have an audacious mission, and we're building a lot of things for the first time — from the first DTC pharma business within the healthcare ecosystem to the data infrastructure for providing real-world evidence in the largest category of chronic disease. It takes superpowers to build something simple and intuitive within the complex healthcare market, so we identify and work as a team from our individual points of strength. Not everyone has to be good at everything, but we know that when we harness what we're each great at, we're unstoppable.</p>
<p><b>
Small wins create big wins</b>: We ground every experience in optimism, recognizing and celebrating successes along the way. We break projects down into smaller components. And we focus on where we have momentum. We always plan for larger goals with the knowledge that our plans will evolve as we achieve smaller milestones.</p>
<p><b>
You're in control</b>: While we're headquartered in New York, we don't let location stand in the way of the best talent — and from coaches to engineers, many of us are fully remote. Our business is multi-faceted, so each Calibrater is hired to be an expert in their piece of it — in control of their own initiatives, in control of their own impact, and in control of driving their own (real) results.</p>
<p><b>
Real results matter</b>: We're obsessed with outcomes because when our members win, we win, and the data proves that we've built the best metabolic health program on the market. We're purposeful, optimistic, and relentlessly confident that we can solve the biggest medical issue of the 21st century.</p><br/>

<h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>
Our Values</b></h2>
<p>
We believe we can help build a future for everyone.</p>
<ul>
<li>We aim to be daring, but humble: We look for bold ideas — regardless of structure and stage — and help them scale by pairing engineers with subject matter experts to build tools that accelerate the pace of social progress.</li>
<li>We want to learn fast, but build for the long-term: We want to iterate fast and help bring new solutions to the table, but we also realize that important breakthroughs often take decades, or even centuries.</li>
<li>Stay close to the real problems: We engage directly in the communities we serve because no one understands our society's challenges like those who live them every day.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our success is dependent on building teams that include people from different backgrounds and experiences who can challenge each other's assumptions with fresh perspectives. To that end, we look for a diverse pool of applicants including those from historically marginalized groups — women, people with disabilities, people of color, formerly incarcerated people, people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or gender nonconforming, first and second generation immigrants, veterans, and people from different socioeconomic backgrounds.</p></div><h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>

Catalia Health is working to improve the way people coping with illness comply with taking their medication and managing chronic disease. Our Mabu healthcare coach is a novel interactive robotic companion built on top of psychological theories of relationship development combined with current human-robot interaction work. This core platform builds strong relationships between the robot and the patient by having regular conversations to help them better manage their ongoing healthcare challenges. The information generated as a result of these conversations is shared with their doctor to help to improve their overall care.</p><p>
The Mabu platform is based on founder Dr. Cory Kidd’s 15+ years of experience in healthcare technology and human-robot interaction. This is combined with a strong core team that has been developing the technology (hardware and software) and user experience for most of the past year. Mabu was designed in collaboration with IDEO, the pre-eminent design firm, while Catalia Health was Startup in Residence at IDEO’s San Francisco studio for five months.</p><p>
Catalia Health is backed by a group of investors that includes some large Silicon Valley funds. We have major industry customers with whom we are rolling out our products. We’re looking for collaborators who want to join a team focused on solving real-world healthcare challenges for a large number of people.</p><p>
We’re a small, tight team working to change the future of healthcare. We work hard but spend our evenings and weekends at home (or out — it’s your time). We’re a healthcare company foremost, so everyone’s well-being is our priority. We were very remote-friendly before COVID-19 (and about 50% remote), so are flexible on your location. Our one office is in San Francisco, so if you’re in the Bay Area or want to be, you’re welcome to work there once we reopen the office.</p><p>
We welcome diversity and believe in hiring the right person as opposed to the right combination of buzzwords. We’re more interested in hiring enthusiastic learners looking to grow than we are in hiring know-it-all’s and been-there-done-that’s. Come grow with us.</p></div>
<br/>
<div>Job Description<p><br/>
This role is to create a bridge between our content development and engineering teams. After a conversation with Mabu is designed and dialogue has been written, that text needs to go into a format that can be used by Mabu’s conversation engine, along with additional scripting files to support the flow of conversation. In this role, you will receive Mabu dialogue and conversation design instructions from the content team, then create/populate conversation files (trees), Python/Lua script files, and enter/update dialogue into the correct databases. The resulting conversation can then be run on Mabu for review, iteration, and eventually as a full product. For this role, we are looking for scripting experience, organization, and most importantly, someone who enjoys collaborating with both the technical and non-technical roles involved in the product creation process.</p></div>
<br/>
<div>Qualifications<br/>
<ul><li>
Python scripting experience (or similar, such as Lua)</li><li>
Highly organized and logical thinker, good at translating between non-technical and technical team members. Excited to work with our content and medical team.</li><li>
CS/IT/IS background or programming experience</li><li>
Familiarity with database structures</li><li>
Interest in conversation design</li></ul><br/>

Ciitizen’s mission is to provide Earth’s 7.3 billion citizens with control of their complete health information and give them the choice of sharing it with whomever they want. Period. With this new ownership, patients can share their health history with caregivers, share for second opinions, and with companies/researchers who may hold the answer to their treatment.</p><p>
All patients have a right to all of their health information, yet existing portals pull only minimal clinical information from a fraction of health care institutions. Current “interoperability” initiatives leave the patient out of the picture and often rely on armies of manual labor to extract key health insights from unstructured textual data—an expensive model which doesn’t scale.</p><p>
In the near future, citizens will walk into a clinical facility and, with a simple tap of a mobile device, release their health information to themselves, where Ciitizen normalizes unstructured data from across the healthcare ecosystem into actionable visualizations for patients, their caregivers, and clinicians.</p><p>
Ciitizen has assembled an all-star team, led by its CEO, Anil Sethi (last company was sold to Apple), and is backed by a strong investment team led by Andreessen Horowitz.</p><br/>

Catalia Health is working to improve the way people coping with illness comply with taking their medication and managing chronic disease. Our Mabu healthcare coach is a novel interactive robotic companion built on top of psychological theories of relationship development combined with current human-robot interaction work. This core platform builds strong relationships between the robot and the patient by having regular conversations to help them better manage their ongoing healthcare challenges. The information generated as a result of these conversations is shared with their doctor to help to improve their overall care.</p><p>
The Mabu platform is based on founder Dr. Cory Kidd’s 15+ years of experience in healthcare technology and human-robot interaction. This is combined with a strong core team that has been developing the technology (hardware and software) and user experience for most of the past year. Mabu was designed in collaboration with IDEO, the pre-eminent design firm, while Catalia Health was Startup in Residence at IDEO’s San Francisco studio for five months.</p><p>
Catalia Health is backed by a group of investors that includes some large Silicon Valley funds. We have major industry customers with whom we are rolling out our products. We’re looking for collaborators who want to join a team focused on solving real-world healthcare challenges for a large number of people.</p><p>
We’re a small, tight team working to change the future of healthcare. We work hard but spend our evenings and weekends at home (or out — it’s your time). We’re a healthcare company foremost, so everyone’s well-being is our priority. We were very remote-friendly before COVID-19 (and about 50% remote), so are flexible on your location. Our one office is in San Francisco, so if you’re in the Bay Area or want to be, you’re welcome to work there once we reopen the office.</p><p>
We welcome diversity and believe in hiring the right person as opposed to the right combination of buzzwords. We’re more interested in hiring enthusiastic learners looking to grow than we are in hiring know-it-all’s and been-there-done-that’s. Come grow with us.</p></div>

The Interview Process</b></h4>
<h4 class=""jobSectionHeader"">Our team believes that interviews are a two-way process and we strive to make them enjoyable without any “gotchas.” The interview process starts with a call with a member of our warm, amazing recruiting team who will tell you more about the job and the company. Then, you’ll meet the engineering manager for the team, Rob, who will walk you through the specifics of the position, the team structure, what we’re looking for, and of course, answer any questions you will have. This interview will last 45 minutes. Then there’s a technical take home assignment where you’ll be working on a practical problem in the language of your choice. The take home assignment is not timed but most people take about two hours or less. Finally, we will schedule you for another four or five meetings with other team members to discuss everything from Carta’s culture to cross-team collaboration and what you can expect, and what is expected from you.</h4><br/>

Across our core initiatives of Science and Education, we're pairing engineering with grantmaking, impact investing, policy work, and advocacy, to progress in our mission of building an inclusive, just and healthy future for everyone.</p>
<h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>
Our Values</b></h2>
<p>
We believe we can help build a future for everyone.</p>
<ul>
<li>We aim to be daring, but humble: We look for bold ideas — regardless of structure and stage — and help them scale by pairing engineers with subject matter experts to build tools that accelerate the pace of social progress.</li>
<li>We want to learn fast, but build for the long-term: We want to iterate fast and help bring new solutions to the table, but we also realize that important breakthroughs often take decades, or even centuries.</li>
<li>Stay close to the real problems: We engage directly in the communities we serve because no one understands our society's challenges like those who live them every day.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our success is dependent on building teams that include people from different backgrounds and experiences who can challenge each other's assumptions with fresh perspectives. To that end, we look for a diverse pool of applicants including those from historically marginalized groups — women, people with disabilities, people of color, formerly incarcerated people, people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or gender nonconforming, first and second generation immigrants, veterans, and people from different socioeconomic backgrounds.</p></div><h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>
